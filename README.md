# Jonathan Owens' Portfolio

Hello! My name is **Jonathan Owens**, and I am a student majoring in **Cyber Security**. I am retired Navy, a Father of 4 beautiful children and a husband to such an amazing woman. 

## Projects I am currently working on

### Project 1: [Graduation]
I know it is not really a project, but my main focus is school and trying to graduate with honors. 

### Project 2: [Children]
Again, I apologize on these not really being actually projects, but all my time and effort goes towards school and children. As a father of four I really do not have much time to spare on myself other than my classes for school.
